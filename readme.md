### Tabu Search shortest-path strategy 

this notebook implements a shortest-path algorithm based on Tabu search, designed to work even on graphs with negative weights

The overall strategy is:

1. **Initial Solution (Greedy Path)**
A fast greedy search builds an initial path from start to goal. 
It is not guaranteed to be optimal and it simply provides a feasible starting point for the search

1. **Local Search Improvement**
The initial path is refined by a small local search step.
Each intermediate node is replaced with alternative nodes that connect to its neighbors and yield a lower total cost of the path

1. **Neighborhood Generation**
new candidate solutions (neighbors) are generated by:
   - selecting a random cut point inside the current path
   - rebuilding the suffix using the greedy search
   - removing cycles by filtering repeated nodes
   - validating the resulting path

1. **Tabu Search** for each iteration:
    - a set of valid neighbor paths is generated
    - each candidate’s total cost is evaluated
    - tabu list prevent revisiting recent solutions
    - the best acceptable neighbor is selected and locally improved before the next iteration

### A* search shortest-path strategy 

it requires that all edge weights are non-negative, 
A* assumes that once a node is popped from the priority queue with the smallest f = g + h, its shortest path cost g is final. With a negative edge a later relaxation could produce a smaller g, violating the assumption

is it admissible? only if edge weights represent real geometric distances, or at least the true path cost is never smaller than the Euclidean distance (if the edge weights represent anything else, the euclidean distance may overestimate)

is it consistent? again this is true when edge weights reflect actual geometric distances

$$
d(n, \text{goal}) = \sqrt{(x_n - x_g)^2 + (y_n - y_g)^2}
$$
